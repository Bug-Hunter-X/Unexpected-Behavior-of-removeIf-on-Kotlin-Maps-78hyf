This repository demonstrates a subtle but important difference in how Kotlin's `removeIf` function operates on different collection types.  The core issue centers around the use of `removeIf` with `MutableMap` which shows an unexpected behavior that is not immediately apparent. Understanding this behavior is crucial for writing robust and predictable Kotlin code.  The `Bug.kt` file showcases the unexpected behavior of `removeIf` on Maps, while `BugSolution.kt` offers explanations and alternative approaches.
